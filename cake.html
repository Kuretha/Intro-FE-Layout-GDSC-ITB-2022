      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 pints ripe, well-rinsed strawberries</li>
        <li>½ cup sugar, or more to taste
        </li>
        <li>½ cup sugar, or more to taste
        </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sugar
        </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>5 teaspoons baking powder
        </li>
        <li>1¼ cups butter
        </li>
        <li>3 cups whipping cream
        </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pick over and hull strawberries. Cut in half or slice, depending on size. Gently crush about a quarter of the berries with a fork to release their juices. Mix with remaining berries and the ½ cup of sugar, adding more sugar if necessary. Set aside, covered, for about half an hour to develop flavor.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
        </li>
        <li>Into a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, salt and baking powder. Add ¾ cup of softened butter, and rub into dry ingredients as for pastry. Add 1¼ cups cream, and mix to a soft dough. Knead the dough for one minute on a lightly floured pastry board, then roll it out to about ½-inch thickness. Using a 3-inch biscuit cutter, cut an even number of rounds - 2 rounds per serving.
        </li>
        <li>Use a little of the butter to grease a baking sheet. Place half the rounds on it. Melt remaining butter and brush a little on the rounds; place remaining rounds on top. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, and pull shortcakes apart. Brush the insides with some of the remaining melted butter.</li>
        <li>Beat remaining cream until it thickens. Add vanilla. Beat again just until thick.</li>
        <li>Place a bottom half of a shortcake on each plate. Top with a generous spoonful of berries. Cover with a top half, add a few more berries, and top with whipped cream. Serve immediately.</li>
      </ul>
