      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil
        </li>
        <li>1/3 cup high quality popcorn kernels
        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter or more to taste, optional</li>
        <li>Salt to taste
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Heat the oil in a 3-quart thick-bottomed saucepan on medium high heat. If you are using coconut oil, allow all of the solid oil to melt.</li>
        <li>Put 3 or 4 popcorn kernels into the oil, wait for the popcorn kernels to pop.
          </li>
        <li>When the kernels pop, add the rest of the 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels in an even layer
        </li>
        <li>This method first heats the oil to the right temperature, then waiting 30 seconds brings all of the other kernels to a near-popping temperature so that when they are put back on the heat, they all pop at about the same time.</li>
        </li>
        <li>The popcorn should begin popping soon, and all at once. Once the popping starts in earnest, gently shake the pan by moving it back and forth over the burner.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the lid and dump the popcorn immediately into a wide bowl.
        </li>
        <li>If you are adding butter, you can easily melt it by placing the butter in the now empty, but hot pan.</li>
        <li>Fun toppings for the popcorn: Spanish smoked paprika, nutritional yeast, cayenne powder, chili pepper, curry powder, cumin, grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
      </ul>
